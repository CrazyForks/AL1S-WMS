# AL1S WMS

AL1S WMS is a lightweight, self-hosted warehouse manager for the home.

It helps a household answer practical questions: what is on hand, where it is stored, what needs buying, what is nearing expiry, and how much has been spent this month. Inspired by [Grocy](https://grocy.info).

Stocktaking, purchasing, and finance share one data trail. Receiving a purchase creates a stock batch and transaction; recording its cost updates actual spending, price history, and inventory value. AL1S WMS also exposes an MCP interface so an AI agent can assist within an explicitly authorized scope.

## Who It Is For

- Households organizing food, household supplies, medicine, consumables, or storage rooms.
- Anyone tracking the same item across rooms, cabinets, and refrigerator zones.
- People who want purchase plans, actual costs, and monthly budgets to stay connected instead of maintaining separate spreadsheets.
- Users who want an AI agent to help check stock, expiry, and replenishment suggestions while retaining approval over consequential actions.

## Features

### Inventory and Batches

- Manage item names, barcodes, units, default locations, reorder points, and reorder quantities.
- Organize household inventory through hierarchical locations and categories, with tree views for both.
- Each receipt creates an independent batch with optional production date, expiry date, actual cost, purchase date, and purchase channel.
- A batch may exist in several locations. Stock can be issued from a selected batch or automatically by FEFO, first expiry first out.
- Record receipts, issues, transfers, stocktakes, and batch changes in a complete transaction history.
- Item details bring together stock, batches, purchase records, price trends, and paginated transaction history.

### Alerts and Stocktakes

- Classify stock as insufficient, critical, or depleted from its reorder threshold.
- Highlight expired and soon-to-expire batches so they can be used or handled first.
- Filter inventory by item, location, status, and expiry; sort by receipt time or urgency.
- Enter a physical count directly. Differences are recorded as a receipt or issue with a stocktake reason.

### Purchasing

- Create shopping items with a planned date, destination, purchase channel, and estimated amount; review them in a purchase calendar.
- Linked inventory items bring along their category, unit, and default location. A selected channel can estimate cost from its latest recorded price.
- Low stock produces dynamic replenishment suggestions. Suggestions do not create stock; they become a real shopping item only after a purchase is planned.
- Receiving records the actual quantity, cost, and date as a new batch. The completed item leaves the active list while its purchase and finance history remain traceable.
- Maintain purchase channels and look up products by barcode. Barcode lookup checks household data and local cache before public product sources.

### Finance

- Set a monthly total budget and category budgets; a future month can inherit the latest saved budget until it is changed.
- Track actual spending, planned spending, forecast spending, remaining budget, and budget execution together.
- Category budgets support parent and child categories: a parent cap covers descendant spending while more specific child caps can still be set.
- Review monthly spending trends, budget comparisons, category and channel rankings, paginated purchase records, and inventory valuation.
- Actual spending belongs to the month of stock receipt. Planned amounts affect the forecast only and never replace actual costs.
- Item price history keeps batch-level and channel-level prices for comparing the latest, lowest, and average prices.

### Multiple Homes and AI Agents

- One account can create and switch between multiple homes. Inventory, locations, purchases, and finance data are isolated per home.
- Household-scoped MCP tokens restrict an agent to one home; account-scoped tokens can select an authorized home.
- MCP covers home status, items, locations, categories, batches, receipts, issues, transfers, stocktakes, purchasing, price history, and financial analysis.
- Agents should obtain explicit confirmation before budget changes, deletions, or other consequential operations. Inventory writes use idempotency keys for safe retries.

## What It Is Not For

- Businesses, studios, stores, or other commercial settings that need approvals, supplier contracts, fulfillment, and complex role models.
- Professional finance workflows such as bank synchronization, income, invoices, reimbursement, tax, freight allocation, coupons, double-entry bookkeeping, or currency conversion.
- ERP, WMS, POS, or supply-chain workloads requiring bulk operations, warehouse slotting, wave picking, or compliance-grade audit controls.
- Turning the household into a logistics center solely because a three-month-old cucumber appeared in the refrigerator. It can, however, help deal with that cucumber first.

## TODOs

- [ ] Multi-user support, including household membership and role-based access control (RBAC).
- [ ] Import, export, backup, and restore for household data.
- [ ] Recurring shopping templates and replenishment rules for regularly purchased items.
- [ ] Configurable expiry and stock reminders, exposed through MCP so an AI agent or external automation can deliver them.

## Deployment

### Docker

Docker is required. The following commands build the image, start the service, and persist SQLite data in a Docker volume:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RicterZ/AL1S-WMS.git
cd AL1S-WMS
docker build -t al1s-wms .
docker run -d \
  --name al1s-wms \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v al1s-wms-data:/data \
  al1s-wms
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and complete the initial setup. The SQLite database is stored at `/data/al1s-wms.db` inside the container. Persist `/data`, or all household data will be lost when the container is recreated.

A host directory can be easier to integrate with an existing backup policy:

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/al1s-wms/data
docker run -d \
  --name al1s-wms \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /srv/al1s-wms/data:/data \
  al1s-wms
```

Back up `/data/al1s-wms.db` regularly. For an internet-facing deployment, place the application behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS and restrict access to its management surface.

### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP service port. |
| `BIND_ADDRESS` | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP listen address. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `/data/al1s-wms.db` in the image | SQLite database path. |
| `STATIC_ROOT` | `/app/public` in the image | Web static asset directory. |
| `APIZERO_API_KEY` | unset | Enables authenticated ApiZero barcode lookup; without it, AL1S WMS uses an anonymous quota and public sources. |
| `BARCODE_USER_AGENT` | built-in value | Overrides the User-Agent used for public barcode data sources. |

## MCP and AI Agents

AL1S WMS exposes a Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint:

```text
https://your-domain.example/mcp
```

Create a token under **Settings -> MCP Access Tokens**, then configure an MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "al1s-wms": {
      "url": "https://your-domain.example/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer al1s_REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An agent should begin with `get_home_context` and `get_home_overview`, then inspect items, locations, batches, or shopping plans for the task at hand. `get_agent_guide` describes the supported receipt, purchase, expiry-handling, and stocktake workflows.

- A household-scoped token needs no `homeId` and can access only its bound home.
- An account-scoped token can access multiple homes, so the agent must select and provide a `homeId`.
- Confirm targets and amounts before writes such as budgeting, deletion, issuing, or receiving. Every inventory write needs a unique `idempotencyKey`; reuse it only to retry the same operation.

## Development and Verification

The project uses a pnpm workspace. After installing dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Run the full verification suite with:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```
